--- HOW TO ADD A LANGUAGE --

Create a new file called whateveryouwant.php

For example, de.php for a german language file

Copy the whole content from en.php

Change $lang['en'] to $lang['de'] if the file is called de.php, $lang['ru'] if the file is called ru.php ...

You will have this, for example:
'error_steamid_whitelisted' => "This SteamID is whitelisted."

DO not touch this part: 'error_steamid_whitelisted'
You only need to change this: "This SteamID is whitelisted."

When you're done, go here /admin/language.php and add your language!
